# Flipper-Project
Repository containing my work and experiments with the flipper zero.

## Projects

### Use Flipper Zero to control Chromecast
To control a Chromecast I think we have two angles, pair the flipper to the chromecast by making it think it is an OG remote or capture and emulate bluetooth packets.  
I will try to capture bluetooth packets using the wifi (and BT) devboard.
#### Flashing wifi devboard with lastest Marauder Firmware.

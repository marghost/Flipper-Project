# What is in here
This is my personal collection of files I build by experimenting with my Flipper.  

## Other files to add to your flipper zero
I strongly suggest you get the files from UberGuidoZ's by cloning this repo : https://github.com/skizzophrenic/Ubers-SD-Files and drop those files on your SD Card.  

I suggest doing this on a linux OS or to disable your AV inside windows, because some of those files will definitively trigger your AV.

You can get more info on what is inside those files by taking a look at UberGuidoZ repo :
